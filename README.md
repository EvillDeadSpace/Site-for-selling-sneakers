# Site-for-selling-sneakers

I am currently working on this website, this is a very early version of the site and I will slowly upgrade it over time.

Technologies I used: HTML, JS and TAILWIND (CSS) and of course UI components

Here is the link to my website:

Feel free to write for some advice, I have all the links, THANK YOU!
